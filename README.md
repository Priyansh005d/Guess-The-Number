## 🎯 Guess The Number Game

A simple Python console game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the program gives a hint whether the number is higher or lower than the correct answer.

### 🧠 How It Works

* The program generates a random number from 1 to 100.
* You keep guessing until you find the correct number.
* After each wrong guess, it tells you:

  * "Higher Number Please" (if your guess is too low)
  * "Lower Number Please" (if your guess is too high)
* It also counts your total attempts.

### 💡 Example Output

```
Guess The Number : 45  
Higher Number Please  
Guess The Number : 67  
Lower Number Please  
Guess The Number : 58  
You Guessed the Correct Number 58 in 3 attempts
